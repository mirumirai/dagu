## Hardware
The hardware is envisioned as a low-cost rugged laptop or tablet, with solar cells on the back. This would enable charging in the sun while not in use. A handle or carrying case allowing it to be strapped down. A lucite or plastic shell. A low-power CPU. On the side you'd want ruggedized ports, including a USB, ethernet, and power adapter port. A single-screen interface with a industrial-style touchscreen.
